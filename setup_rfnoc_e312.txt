Make my own list without any of the python tools.  since we will install those manually from Python and pip.  Give preference to the one that mentions ubuntu 18.04 if there is a conflict. (only difference was some zmq versions and libcppunit 1.14)

problem with libqwt5-qt4-dev.  leave it out for now.
It wants to install python anyway. might as well put all the other python dependencies into the list.  fuck it.  See which python version we get

# That's all well and good.  But now, download a fresh copy of python python 2.7.15 and setup pip for our SDK section.
Download 
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2715/
https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py

Unzip Python source to directory of choice
$ tar -xzvf Python-2.7.15.tgz
$ mv Python-2.7.15 ~/prefix/src/
$ cd ~/prefix/src/Python-2.7.15/

I want to wipe out the existing python with this known version so I can control package installations more carefully with pip.  Really should have installed this first rather than using the automatic version that came from apt.  If I intalled this first, I could have 

$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ python

view version number 2.7.15 from compiled source today. check for numpy
>>>import numpy
(not found.  good install it with pip!)

Now, run the install SDK script (it requires python.  thats why we waited until now to install)

Install SDK
$ sh oecore-x86_64-armv7ahf-vfp-neon-toolchain-nodistro.0.sh 

It asks for target directory.
~/prefix

After SDK is setup.  
$ cd ~/prefix/sysroots$ ls
 ---> armv7ahf-vfp-neon-oe-linux-gnueabi  
 ---> x86_64-oesdk-linux
browse and see python installations.
cd ~/prefix/sysroots/x86_64-oesdk-linux/usr/bin
./python --version
 ---> v 2.7.9

Install another copy of Python into the SDK x86 directory to ensure we are using the same version on host system and compiled in toolchain.

$ cd ~/prefix/src/Python-2.7.15/
$ ./configure --prefix=~/prefix/sysroots/x86_64-oesdk-linux/usr 	
$ make

That didn't work out.  missing something in this prefix directory.  In host computer, it was all installed with apt prerequisites.  Not easy to do for a separate directory in prefix.  shit.  Try to get a version of pip that will work in python 2.7.9 in SDK x86 sysroot.

fails on plistlib.

try in host python.  no success installing pip like this.  Screw it.  go back and build all the other tools for e312 and see if I can get the gr-ettus python lib "ettus" to happen.  I started shaving yaks yesterday with UHD installation when the real problem before was really gr-ettus python module not being installed.  might be able to fix this.

===== Build all for E312 same as 3 days ago =========================
